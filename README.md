# WORK IN PROGRESS

We are so excited to announce that we are  in development of CLA Assistant Github Action (a light version of CLA Assistant). With this Action, we can get rid of the need of a centrally managed database and rather storing all the contributors data in the repository's file system itself.  This action won't be able to provide all the feature-sets  of the current `CLA Assistant OAuth App`, However, this will work just fine If you want to configure CLA Assistant for a repo and store all the contributors data inside the repository. 

## Advantages
1. decentralizing the database of contributors
1. fully integrated with github environment 
1. no UI is required
1. no need to grant any permission/scope
